    <p>Hi!<br><br>My name is Emma (wholeness; universal) and I am a dancer, artist, business woman, tech nerd, nomad and devotee of life.<br><br>I believe that there is a way to honor slow living and our feminine cycle and at the same time go after our dreams and desires with passionate fire. I hope to convey this through my photography and writing as well as my collaborations with mindful and sustainable companies and companies as a speaker, marketing manager, UX/UI designer, strategist, project manager, developer and change maker.</p><br>
